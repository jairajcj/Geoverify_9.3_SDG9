2. Carbon Credit Forgery-Proof Sentinel (AI/Web3 Auditing) give a title for this project

The combination of  AI for environmental verification and Blockchain for immutable auditing is powerful. Here are the best titles for Project 2, designed to immediately communicate the unique value proposition:

🌳 Project Titles: Carbon Credit Forgery-Proof Sentinel
Category	Title Option	Key Communication to Judges
Punchy / Marketable	GeoVerify	Simple, modern, emphasizes the core function: geographical verification.
Forest Ledger	Directly links the environmental asset (Forest) with the technology (Ledger/Blockchain).
CarbonProof AI	Focuses on the output: AI-driven proof of the carbon asset.
Academic / Precise	AI-DLT Protocol for Trustless Carbon Sink Verification	Clearly names the technologies (AI, Distributed Ledger Technology) and the problem solved (Trustless Verification).
The Geospatial Chain of Custody	Emphasizes the creation of an immutable, verifiable history for a digital asset (the carbon credit).
Recommended Hackathon Title:
GeoVerify: AI-Blockchain Sentinel for Green Asset Auditing
This title is the most effective as it combines the two unique selling points: Geo (Geospatial AI) and Verify (Trustless Blockchain Auditing).
